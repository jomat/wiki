styx is a mobile device running debian with changing net connections. It's traffic has to be secured by tinc. To accomplish this, the default gw has to be set to a private VPN gateway. I use policy routing to avoid routing the encrypted tunnel data over the tunnel.

Current set up works with wireless connections either with DHCP or statically configured.
It doesn't leave the system in a clean state after putting a interface down.

Software pieces in use:

* ifup/ifdown
* wpa_supplicant
* dhclient3

[[files/etc/wpa_supplicant.conf]]

[[files/etc/network/if-up.d/jomat]]

[[files/etc/dhcp/script.sh]]

[[files/usr/local/sbin/set_vpngw.sh]]
